    "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical method used to evaluate the importance of a word in a doucment within a corpus. It is widely applied in information retrieval, text mining, and natural language processing. The core idea is: **a word that appears frequently in a document (high TF) but rarely across the corpus (high IDF) is more significant to that document**."

    "#### Cons\n",
    "* Ignores word position, semantics, and context.\n",
    "* May dilute term importance in long documents (requires normalization).\n",
    "* Fails to handler synonyms and polysemy (e.g. \"bank\" as a riverbank vs. a financial institution)."
